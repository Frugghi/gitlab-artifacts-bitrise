  Configuration (environments) specified in 'app' will be available
    for every workflow.

  The Trigger Map ('trigger_map') defines mapping between trigger patterns
    and workflows.
  You can run workflows directly with bitrise: bitrise run workflow-name
    Or you can 'trigger' a build: bitrise trigger some-pattern

   With this example 'trigger_map' if you 'bitrise trigger test'
    or 'bitrise trigger test-1' or specify any other pattern
    which starts with 'test' then the 'test' workflow will be used.
   In any other case (ex: 'bitrise trigger something-else') the
    workflow called 'fallback' will be used.

  Workflows ('workflows') are where you can define different, separate scenarios,
    which you can then 'bitrise run' or 'bitrise trigger'.

    description: |-
      You can use this workflow by running: bitrise run test
      Or by triggering: bitrise trigger test
      If you use trigger, you can trigger it with any pattern
        which starts with 'test', like: bitrise trigger test-1
        or: bitrise trigger test/1
      You can define the mapping between trigger patterns and
        workflows in the 'trigger_map' section.
